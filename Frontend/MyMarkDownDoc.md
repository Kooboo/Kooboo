Open Source Self-Hosted Alternatives to Hundreds of SaaS Applications

# What is the Problem with SaaS?

Many SaaS applications are released as open source on GitHub but charge for hosted solutions. Paying $20 for each of the 10 applications adds up quickly, and managing isolated applications is cumbersome.
 

# Self-Hosted Alternatives

I have created a solution for the community to self-host numerous open source applications on their desktop or in the cloud.  

It can be run on Windows, Mac or Linux server, and it is totally FREE. 

Currently, there are about a hundred applications and tools included, such as: 

DrawIO, Excalidraw, Quant UX Prototype, TL Draw canvas, Polotno studio, Variant Form, Grapes page builder, Unlayer page designer, API Test, Paint Board, Toast Image Editor, Json editor, Mermaid Diagram, vvveb js designer, SVG image editor, Block note writer, nunu 3d Studio, Glyphs Font Studio, Pictode Drawing, IDraw UI designer, FileRobot Image editor, Mongo DB modeler, DrawDB Database designer, TypeFlow editor and more.
